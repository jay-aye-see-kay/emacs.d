* Emacs from scratch notes

** Part 1: Packages and basic setup
- help commands
  - all start with =c-h=
- =c-x= =c-f=  find file
- =c-x c-b= find buffer

** Part 2: UI tweaks
- =c-x c-e= evaluate expression under point
- how do I eval a whole buffer?
- `use-package` has a `:diminish` option which stops hover info going into messages

** Part 3: Keybindings and evil mode
Built in ways to set keymaps:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; create global keymap
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x y z") 'function)
  ;; create mode keymap
  (define-key mode-name-map (kbd "C-x y z") 'function)
#+end_src

But normally we don't define these directly with `use-package` or `general.el`

** Part 4:  Projectile and Magit
- Projectile is a suite of commands like fzf in vim, all keybinds start with =C-c p=
- Open Magit status buffer with =C-x g=, everything happens from there
- Magit keybinds are mostly the same as fugitive, but will show help with =?= or with a partial keycombo, for example =c= will open completions and =c= again will commit
- Magit provides a =Instant Fixup= and =Branch spin off= commands on top of what git provides and they look super useful
- =Forge= looks worth setting up for creating/editing PRs and issues from emacs

** Part 5:  Org Mode basics
- create link with =c-c c-l= (the underlying text is =[[link][description]]=)
- follow link with =c-c c-o=
- surrounding astrixes make *bold* and slashes make /italic/
- headings with leading astrix(es) =*=
- ordered, unordered, and check lists the same as markdowns
- tables are same as markdown
- code blocks:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(message "run\n me")
#+end_src


** NEXT_UP Part 6:  Organise your life with Org Mode
- =M-x org-agenda a= to show agenda
- =C-c C-t= change task states
- =C-c C-s= schedule a task (=shift <arrow-key>= to select calendars)

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
  ;; done states are after the "|", key in bracket is the shortcut for this state
  '((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "|" "DONE(d!)")))
#+end_src

- up to 25mins in the video

** Misc Thoughts
*** Org
- the =S-M-RET= shortcut to create a new checklist item sucks, something better
- the =C-c C-x C-b= shortcut to toggle checklists sucks, and doesn't even add if required
- org agenda looses all evil keybinds, can I put some back it?

*** Magit
- it seems mostly intuitive but I should probably practice a bit more, just get the basics done
